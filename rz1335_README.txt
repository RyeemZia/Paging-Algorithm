Compile with: paging % g++ -o paging paging.cpp

FIFO:

I used a combination of a 2 queues 

LRU:
I used a vector filled with frame objects

Second chance:
I tried to use a queue and vector

I don't know if my output is correct, but I suspect they are off when I tested with 5 frames

I believe I have some bugs along the way of the methods I used that are skewing the results. I tried to debug but I could not find them or figure out an alternative. As far as the concepts, I do understand them, as a whole I tried to implement them as best as I could in code.
